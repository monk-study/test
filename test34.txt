Given that multiple NBAs occur infrequently in the data, the OneVsRest with XGBoost might actually be a reasonable baseline approach. Let's analyze:

Pros of Current OneVsRest Approach:
1. Good performance on single labels
   - NBA5: F1 = 0.73
   - NBA12: F1 = 0.71
   - NBA3: F1 = 0.72
   These are decent scores for a baseline model

2. Data Distribution Reality
   - Most cases (>80%) are single NBA attempts
   - Few multi-label cases might not justify complexity of multi-label specific models

3. Business Context
   - If most real-world cases are single NBAs, optimizing for these cases makes sense

Areas for Improvement with Current Approach:
1. NBA4 Performance (F1 = 0.09)
```python
# Add class weights specifically for NBA4
xgb_params.update({
    'scale_pos_weight': len(y[y != 'NBA4_ATTEMPTED']) / len(y[y == 'NBA4_ATTEMPTED'])
})
```

2. Better Feature Engineering
```python
# Add interaction features
def add_interaction_features(df):
    # Example interactions that might be relevant for NBA4
    df['times_paid_ratio'] = df['ttl_times_paid_ptnt_gcn_missing'] / (df['ttl_times_paid_cash_ptnt_gcn_missing'] + 1)
    return df
```

3. Separate Model for Complex Cases
```python
# Keep OneVsRest for single labels but add detector for complex cases
def is_complex_case(features):
    # Logic to detect if a case might need multiple NBAs
    return probability_of_complex_case
```

Recommendation:
1. Stick with OneVsRest + XGBoost for now but:
   - Focus on improving NBA4 performance
   - Add feature engineering
   - Do error analysis on misclassifications

2. Track these metrics:
```python
def detailed_metrics():
    # Single label accuracy
    single_label_accuracy = ...
    
    # Complex case detection
    complex_case_accuracy = ...
    
    # NBA4 specific metrics
    nba4_confusion = ...
    
    return {
        'single_label_acc': single_label_accuracy,
        'complex_case_acc': complex_case_accuracy,
        'nba4_metrics': nba4_confusion
    }
```

Would you like me to:
1. Focus on NBA4 improvement while keeping current approach?
2. Add more detailed error analysis?
3. Implement feature engineering for specific NBAs?

The current approach might be "good enough" for now, especially if the business can tolerate lower accuracy on multi-label cases given their rarity. We can iterate on this baseline rather than switching to a more complex approach prematurely.
